This project presents a novel machine learning method for the cross-lingual classification of Telugu legal documents. By leveraging **FastText word embeddings** trained on summarized English judgments, the system can accurately categorize Telugu legal text without requiring a large labeled Telugu dataset. This research contributes to advancing cross-lingual Natural Language Processing (NLP) and provides a practical tool for legal professionals managing linguistic diversity.

### ✨ Key Features

* **Cross-Lingual Approach:** Classifies Telugu text by leveraging word embeddings and patterns learned from English legal summaries.
* **FastText Embeddings:** Utilizes advanced FastText word embeddings to capture semantic relationships that transcend language barriers.
* **Comprehensive Model Comparison:** Implements and rigorously evaluates six classical machine learning models:
    * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    * Random Forest
    * Decision Tree
    * Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)
    * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    * Logistic Regression
* **High Accuracy:** The **Random Forest** classifier was identified as the top-performing model, demonstrating high accuracy in classifying legal domains.
* **Practical Application:** Offers a valuable tool for scholars and legal professionals, accelerating the process of sorting and analyzing Telugu legal documents.
